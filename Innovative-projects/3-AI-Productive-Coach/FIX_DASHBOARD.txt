DASHBOARD SHOWING ZEROS?
========================

YOU MUST VISIT THIS URL FIRST:
http://localhost:5000/use-demo-data

This switches you to the demo user account with all the populated data.

Then refresh the dashboard and you'll see:
- Total Tasks: 41
- Completed: 28
- Focus Time: 1018m
- Pending: 13
- AI insights
- Charts with data

WHY?
Each time you visit the site, it creates a NEW random user.
The demo data is for user "demo-user-12345".
You need to switch to that user first!
